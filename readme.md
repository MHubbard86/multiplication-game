# Which? Front-end Exercise - Matthew Hubbard

This repository provides information and a project boilerplate for completing the test exercise sent to candidates applying for front-end roles at Which?.

To get started you'll need to make sure you have the following software tools installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12 or higher is required)
- [npm](http://npmjs.com/) (this should be installed along with Node.js)

### Installation and setup

1. Clone this Git repository and change to the new directory that has been created:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MHubbard86/multiplication-game.git --depth 1
    cd multiplication-game
    ```

2. Install all of the project dependencies using npm:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Once installed you can run the Webpack development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    Now open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser and you should see a basic HTML page. 
    
    If you open the developer console in the browser, you should see a welcome message which confirms everything is loading and running correctly.

    To stop the server when no longer needed, you can press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> in the terminal.

4. And to run your tests use the following command:

    ```sh
    npm test
    ```

5. Step to run lint: Open the terminal and type the following command.

    ```sh
    npm run lint
    ```
